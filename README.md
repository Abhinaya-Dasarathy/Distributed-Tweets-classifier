# Distributed-Tweets-classifier

The complete project is divided into two phases. In the first phase, we would be getting the required data set of the tweets using Twitter API and store them in HDFS, perform classification of tweets using Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm and Map Reduce paradigm. Later in the second phase, we distribute the classification to multiple nodes in Hadoop to enhance the performance when there are a large number of tweets to classify.

This project was aimed at just getting the categories in which any deals are tweeted. However, twitter is just one example. This distributed classification can be applied to images and videos which make this area more challenging. Image classification still exists in distributed lezrning. However, categorizing videos will pose an interesting challenge to first figure out what the video is all about and what category can it fall on.
